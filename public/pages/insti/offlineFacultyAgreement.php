The Governors accept, however, that where a Teacher/Faculty is showing signs of not being capable of performing the duties required of him/her, disciplinary procedures may not be an appropriate response. In
                            such cases, the Institute will implement the Capability Procedure, a copy of which is available on request.</p>
