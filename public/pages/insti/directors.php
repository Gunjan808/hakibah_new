				<p style="font:bold; font-size: 18px" class="pb-1">Dear Students,</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					I believe that your hard work should always be a vector
					quantity rather than scalar one, which has a magnitude as well a
					direction. The efforts put by you will be the magnitude and our
					guidance will be the direction to reach your destination of IITs,
					Olympiads, NEET, and other competitive examinations.</p>
				<p class="text-justify mt-3"> It's important
					to note at this juncture that the changing pattern of IITJEE will have
					several new challenges to answer and a consistent approach will be
					required. I would reinstate the fact that our R & D department under
					the guidance of our senior faculties has designed the curriculum to
					meet all the requirements of the new pattern. The direction is assured,
					now it's your turn to add magnitude to it.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify mt-3">
					A good academic support along with a conducive environment to learn is
					what First Prize has developed over the years. We not only cater to the
					academic requirements of the students but also provide a constant source of
					motivation through counseling and expert lectures. Our dedicated team of
					faculties are always on their toes to help the students, be it an academic or a
					non-academic need. We have nurtured a culture of healthy competition
					amongst the students to motivate them to give their best. I am sure that our
					proactive approach towards best academic delivery will beat all odds of
					competition
				</p>
